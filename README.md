### ARTe Real Time Operating System
ARTe (Arduino Real-Time extension) is an extension to the Arduino framework, developed by the Retis Lab at Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, that supports multitasking and real-time preemptive scheduling. Thanks to ARTe, the user can easily specify and run multiple concurrent loops at differents rates, in addition to the single execution cycle provided by the standard Arduino framework.
